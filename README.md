#Hotel Booking Analysis Data
Welcome to the Hotel Booking Analysis Data project! This repository contains the analysis and insights gathered from a comprehensive dataset of hotel bookings, focusing on trends, challenges, and actionable strategies for the hotel industry.

Project Overview
As part of a capstone project, our team took on the role of a marketing group for a new hotel startup. Our main objective was to analyze regional hotel industry data to uncover key market features and provide actionable insights regarding booking trends, cancellation rates, customer behavior, and distribution channels.

Problem Statement
We have been provided with detailed booking data for both city and resort hotels. The aim is to:

Understand market trends in the regional hotel industry.

Analyze key metrics such as cancellations, distribution channel performance, seasonal fluctuations, and customer preferences.

Provide recommendations and actionable insights for marketing and operations.

Data Summary
The dataset includes booking details such as:

Hotel type (City or Resort)

Booking and arrival dates

Lead time

Number of guests (adults, children, babies)

Reserved and assigned room types

Meal preferences

Booking status (canceled or not)

Distribution channels

Country of origin

Special requests

Days on waiting list

Key Hypotheses & Insights
Booking traffic varies unevenly across months: The volume of bookings changes significantly throughout the year; it is not uniform.

Cancellation rates by country: Most countries have similar cancellation rates except Portugal, which is notably higher.

Market segment waiting times differ: Different market segments have varying average waiting days.

City hotels price higher: City hotels generally charge a higher median price than resort hotels.

Meal package preference: Most guests prefer only breakfast over full meal packages.

Solo/children room choices: Solo travelers and children generally select Type-A or Type-B rooms.

Cancellation factors: Lead time has a strong positive correlation with cancellations; higher lead time often leads to more cancellations.

Channel analysis:

"TA/TO" (Travel Agent/Tour Operator) channels consistently have the highest cancellation rates and make the most special requests.

"Corporate" channels bring in the most repeated guests, while "Direct," "GDS," and "TA/TO" channels generate the highest average monthly ADR (Average Daily Rate).

Main Findings
Seasonality: Bookings and customer demand fluctuate across different months—marketing strategies should align with these trends.

Cancellations: City hotels face a significantly higher cancellation rate (41.73%) compared to resort hotels (27.76%), with new customers canceling more than repeat customers.

Distribution Channels: High focus should be placed on "Direct," "GDS," and "TA/TO" channels for revenue, but stricter cancellation policies or deposit requirements may be necessary for "TA/TO" bookings to curb losses.

Customer Preferences: Special request up-sell opportunities are strongest with "TA/TO" and "Direct" channel guests.

Operational Insights: Meal package preferences and customer segmentation can guide offerings and promotional campaigns.

Actionable Recommendations
Allocate more marketing resources to "Direct," "GDS," and "TA/TO" channels to increase revenue.

Implement or increase deposits for "TA/TO" channel reservations to reduce cancellation-related losses.

Send regular updates and promotions to "Corporate" clients to boost repeat bookings.

Encourage staff to promote special services to guests booking via "TA/TO" and "Direct" channels.

Challenges
Managing and representing a large set of diverse variables.

Formulating and testing targeted hypotheses.

Choosing the most effective visualization methods.

Meeting deadlines under project constraints.

Conclusion
This project’s analysis highlights important patterns and opportunities for hotel marketing and operations. Booking trends, customer preferences, and distribution channel performance all present distinct challenges and avenues for growth. Our findings offer a data-driven approach to decision-making in the hotel industry.
