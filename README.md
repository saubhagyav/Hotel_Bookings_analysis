We have been provided with detailed booking data for both **city** and **resort** hotels. The aim is to:

* Understand market trends in the regional hotel industry

* Provide recommendations and actionable insights for marketing and operations

## üìä Data Summary

The dataset includes booking details such as:

* Number of guests (adults, children, babies)
* Reserved and assigned room types
* Meal preferences
* Booking status (canceled or not)
* Distribution channels
* Country of origin
* Special requests
* Days on waiting list

## üîç Key Hypotheses & Insights

* **Booking traffic varies unevenly across months**: Booking volumes fluctuate throughout the year.
* **Cancellation rates by country**: Portugal shows notably higher cancellation rates than other countries.
* **Market segment waiting times differ**: Different segments have varying average waiting periods.
* **City hotels price higher**: City hotels charge a higher median price than resort hotels.
* **Meal package preference**: Most guests prefer only breakfast over full meal plans.
* **Solo/children room choices**: Type-A and Type-B rooms are commonly chosen by solo travelers and guests with children.
* **Cancellation factors**: A strong positive correlation exists between lead time and cancellation likelihood.

#### Channel Analysis:

* **TA/TO (Travel Agent/Tour Operator)**: Highest cancellation rates and most special requests

## üìà Main Findings

* **Cancellations**: City hotels have a higher cancellation rate (41.73%) than resort hotels (27.76%). New customers cancel more than repeat guests.
